W is a lightweight CMS tool, meant to help you design a website using a unique approach. It's targeting artists, or experimental projects.

To have a better idea of what W can do, you can check out the [webiste](https://w.club1.fr).

If tou want to try it out, you can :

- follow the [install instructions](#how-to-install) to host your own instance of W.
- be hosted for free by [club1.fr](https://club1.fr) as an official tester (please contact [vincent+w@club1.fr](mailto:vincent+w@club1.fr) for more info).

W is a free and open source tool under [the AGPLv3 License](LICENSE). The project was initiated in 2018 by [Vincent Peugnet](https://246.eu/vincent-peugnet).

Ideas
-----

**W** was first a tool, based on my way of thinking, as a protesis, to write on ideas and create a self explorating text point n' click game.

It's a mix between a drive, a wiki and a personnal blog. You can create page very quickly and share them with other people or keep them for you and restricted people.  
There is no boundaries beetween taking notes and creating a website. When you create a page, you create a space in internet, a place, that can be public or private. Then, you decide to link it or not with the others places you've created before.
There is a lots of possibilites of creations, for people who need to create multi-aspect labyrinth websites, to use a half public/private mindmap, or even interactives fictions.

Highlights
----------

W try to help you create pages more spontaneously.

Development team
----------------

W is a project created and maintained by [Vincent Peugnet](https://github.com/vincent-peugnet), an amateur computer science enthousiast who can only code in PHP. It includes [Nicolas Peugnet](https://github.com/n-peugnet) (his brother) as JS developer, technical advisor. He's the one that take care of every challenges that are too complicated for Vincent. And more recently, [Julien Bidoret](https://accentgrave.net/) joined the project and did an excellent job of refreshing the user interface.
We can also mention *Fae PrÃ©vost Leygonie* as legendary number one user and issue writer too.

How to install
==============

__Server requirements__

- apache server
- PHP >=7.4.0 and the following extensions: `curl mbstring xml`
- optionally: `gd` or `imagick` PHP extensions for [image optimizer feature](MANUAL.md#optimize-images).

__W__ don't need any database manager as it use a "flat file" system.

You can put W at the root of your domain, or in subfolders. Then access the address in your browser and follow the differents steps.

Install using latest release zip
--------------------------------

Simply download the [latest realease](https://github.com/vincent-peugnet/wcms/releases/latest) from Github, and unzip it in your hosted folder.



Install using Git
-----------------

If you have a SSH access to your server and you are familiar with Git, you can install W from sources. See [Install from sources](#install-from-sources).

### updating

1. update git

        git pull

2. choose a release tag

        git checkout TAG
    
    Replace `TAG` with release name (for example `v3.5.0`). Check [the latest release](https://github.com/vincent-peugnet/wcms/releases/latest) to get the latest release tag.

3. build what's necessary

        make build

Development informations
========================

If you want to contribute to the project.

Prerequisites
-------------

- PHP >=7.4.0
- PHP extensions : `curl mbstring xml gd imagick`
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- _Optionally_ [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

### Debian and derivatives

    sudo apt install php php-curl php-mbstring php-xml composer nodejs npm

Install from sources
--------------------

1.  Clone the git repository.
2.  Install PHP dependencies.

        make vendor

3.  _Optionally_ install and build JS dependencies to get UI enhancements.

        make build

The last two commands can be run at once using only `make`.

PHP development
---------------

You can easily run a dev server using the `serve` target:

    make serve

There is an error reporting debug mode using [Whoops](https://github.com/filp/whoops). It can be enabled by setting the value of `debug` in `config.json` to one of [editors supported by Whoops](https://github.com/filp/whoops/blob/master/docs/Open%20Files%20In%20An%20Editor.md).

JS development
--------------

While developing JS code it is useful to run webpack in watch mode so that the bundles get built at each file change. To do so, use the following command:

    make watch

To run both the php dev server and webpack in watch mode, it is possible to run:

    make dev

Run checks
---------

Multiple tools are used to perform checks on the source code:

-   **phpcs** to lint PHP code

        make lint

-   **phpunit** to run unit test on PHP code
 
        make test

All checks can be run with a single command

    make check [--keep-going]

Publish a new release
---------------------

The release process uses GitHub's CLI so you will need to have it installed (`sudo apt install gh`).
It also uploads sourcemaps to [Sentry](https://sentry.io/).
So to create and publish a new release you will need two access tokens:
-   a [GitHub personnal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with `repository` access
-   a [Sentry authentification token](https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/) with `project:read`, `project:releases` and `org:read` access

saved in a `.env` file like so:

```bash
# .env
GITHUB_TOKEN='<github token value>'
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN='<sentry token value>'
```

Then, to make the release, run one of the following command:

    make release-patch
    make release-minor
    make release-major

To only build the release zip, simply run `make dist`. This will create a zip file in `dist/` of the current version.
