USER MANUAL
===========

Introduction
------------

Welcome to __W__, this manual is here to help you get the best of this tool.

If it's you're first time using it, you should learn how to [create your first page](#create-your-first-page).

If you already know the basics, you may want to check the references :

- Discover how to [navigate](#navigation).
- Get to know the [structure of a page](#page-structure) to edit meta content.
- Learn more about the [URL based commands](#url-based-command-interface) you can type in the address bar.
- Master the [render engine](#page-editing) to release the full potential of __W__.



### Create your first page

This 4 steps tutorial will introduce you to the basic __W__ moves.

#### Add a new page


The first thing you have to do before creating a page is to **choose an address** for this page. Each page have a unique address that identify it, it is the [**page id**](#page-id). You can use the address bar of your web browser to directly access, [edit](#edit) or [delete](#delete) a page.

You can type anything in your address bar. If it is an already exisiting page_id, you will access a page. Otherwise, you will arrive to an empty space waiting to be filled.

Once you've typed an address and found nothing, if you are connected, you now have the opportunity to create a page at this address.

There is two ways to do this :

1. Graphicaly, by clicking the "create" button
2. Using the address bar, by typing `/add` just after the address

There it is ! Congratulation, you've created your first page using W.


#### Edit your page content

Now you should be in front of the [edit interface](#editor) of your page. If you check the address bar, you will now see `/edit` written after your page address.

You can type a few words in the main text area. Once you're happy with what you wrote, it's time to save your work : click on the <kbd>update</kbd> button in the top left corner. You can use the shortcut <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> too if you prefer. After you've done this, you sould have notice that the asterix `*` next to your page_id have left, it's the sign that saving was sucesfull.

Let's come back to the page reading view to see the result of our editing. There are different approaches for doing so :

1. By removing the `/edit` command after your page address
2. Pressing the "display" button (next to "update"), or using <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd> shortcut.

The first method will use the same tab while the second will create a new one, wich is usefull if you want to keep your [edit interface](#editor) open to come back quickly.

You should now see something that look like what you've typed.


#### Create a hyperlink


The [markdown synthax](), this is a formating standard well known accross the web. It's main goal is to be a intermediate between an easy to read prose text, and the internet standard tag language, the HTML. One of the main interest of Markdown, is it is ability to be mixed with HTML. That way, people can type more easily basic text, and switch to HTML at any time, to achieve a more complex layout. You can use the official Markdonw synthax with __W__ alongside with HTML to build your pages.

[Official website describing Markdown synthax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)

One of the most interesting things to do when you use internet publishing, is to create HYPERLINKS. __W__ encourage you creating those links between pages using a very light synthax. There are multiple ways to do it.

1. Using classic HTML : `<a href="<page_id>">click here</a>`
2. Using Markdown :  `[click here](<page_id>)`
3. Using W quick synthax : `[<page_id>]`

All those methods will create a link pointing to the `<page_id>` you've given.

Those kind of links are called internal links beccause they stay inside of your domain. To set a link outside of your website, simply remplace `<page_id>` by


#### Insert images

When adding an image to a page, you can either use an already web-hosted image, wich is a bit dangerous, or host yourself the image using W's [media interface](#media-manager).

Markdown synthax for inserting an image :

    ![<alt_comment>](<image_address>)

It's the equivalent of HTML (More info about `<img>` tag on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Img)) :

    <img src="<image_address>" alt="<alt_comment>">

If your image is already hosted, just use it's URL address for `<image_address>`. Otherwise, access W's [media interface](#medua-manager) using the top bar menu, just after "home", or by typing `<your-W-url>/!media`.

Once you're here, you'll have to first choose, using the navigation panel on the left, or create a folder, by selecting __File > New Folder__ in the menu.

When you've selected the folder you prefer for hosting your image, it's time for uploading it using __File > Upload__. Browse you computer or drag n' drop files onto the "Choose Files" button, then click "Upload". Note that you can upload multiple files at once !

Now you should see your files appearing in the table. W will remove whitespaces and special characters of your medias to avoid synthax problems.

To add the image on your page, the simplest method is to copy the Makdown generated code on the right side.

*For bigger files transfer, you can always use FTP or SSH connections to add, delete, move files by accessing the `/media` directory of your W installation folder*


### Navigation

Discover the differents interfaces of __W__.

#### Home

The Home interface is the main view of your project. You can access it only when you're connected. All the pages of your database are listed here.

The [readers](#reader) and [invite editors](#invite-editor) can't access this interface.

##### Home menu

In the home menu [super editors and above](#super-editor) can :

- __File :__ Import pages as JSON file. (usefull for transfering pages from a W instance to another).
- __Edit :__ Apply changes, render, or delete multiple pages at once.
- __Filters :__ Use your [filtering options](#options) to generate a [automatic menu](#page-list) you can later include in a page.
- __Bookmarks :__ Save your [filtering options](#options) presets here. Common and personnal storages are possible.
- __Display :__ Set columns to be shown (user based) and tag colors.

##### Options

The option panel contains multiples options for sorting and filtering your pages database.

Just select the options you want and press "Fitler". Use the "Reset" button to come back to the default settings. W will keep the settings for the SESSION time.

This panel is also usefull to set up a [page list](#page-list) to include the same list of page you've filtered in any page.

##### Pages

The table is composed of [meta](#meta-infos) datas and actions links that are :

__EDIT__, __READ__, __DELETE__ and __DOWNLOAD__, they are equivalent to [pages commands](#pages-commands). Don't hesitate to open edit or read links in a new tab, to keep the Home view open.

To edit columns you want to see, use the [menu](#home-menu)>Display submenu.

#### Edition

The edition interface is accessible when [typing `/edit`](#edit) after an existing [page_id](#page-id) in the address bar. Or from the [home](#home), by clicking on the pencil button.

[Invite editors](#invite-editor) and [editors](#editor) users can only access edition of pages where they are listed as [author](#authors).

The Edition view is composed of a main content edition area, surounded by two lateral panels that you can deploy or hide.

##### left panel

This is the 

- Meta infos : edit [title](#title), [description](#description) and more infos about your page.
- Templating
- Advanced
- Help : a quick synthax reference for markdown and W synthax

##### contents area

Each tab allow you to edit a different type of content :

[main](#main), [nav](#nav), [aside](#aside)

Note that the MAIN tab is the default opened tab, this is meant to be the most spontaneous place to store information when you are using __W__ in *note taking style*.

##### right panel
